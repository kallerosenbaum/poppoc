A proof-of-concept for my idea on Proof of Payment. For details, see the [wiki page](https://github.com/kallerosenbaum/poppoc/wiki/Proof-of-Payment).

If you want to get straight to the PoP validating code, have a look at [PopServlet.java](https://github.com/kallerosenbaum/poppoc/blob/master/src/main/java/se/rosenbaum/poppoc/servlet/PopServlet.java).
